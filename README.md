# Discord-Link
Discord Link is a fun project made by me (:  What does it do? It connects to any Server with any bot and, reads the messages.  How? You create your Discord Bot and type in your Token, then you type in a code to verify your Session and it works!  License: This project is free to use, but it would be nice to give Credit! C:
